## Why using c?

C have more compatibility, can transfer to other platform easily.

And also have less **RAM** and **flash** usage than c++, which is very precious in **Arduino UNO/Nano**.

The code developed using **atmelstudio7**, you may need a **usbasp/isp** downloader to write the code to UNO using **avrdude** or **progisp**.
